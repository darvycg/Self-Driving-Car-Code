# C++ Hub
In progress: This area will contain all code that was in the C++ projects or could be potentially useful for myself and others. These are some of the projects and work covered in the Udacity Nano-Degree program
## Python to C++
The Histogram filter located in the Python section is rebuilt here as a C++ program. There is no GUI for the program at this time but the code has been validated to output the same results. 

## More to come...

## Disclaimer
Not all code was written by me as some was provided by the class.
