# Introduction to Self-Driving Cars Nano-Degree
In progress: This area will contain all code that was in projects or could be potentially useful for myself and others. These are some of the projects and work covered in the Udacity Nano-Degree program
## C++ Code
Due to the nature of the Self-Driving Car hardware, C++ is used to improve runtimes and dive deeply into best optimaztion techniques and algorithms. This code was compiled with CLion and MinGW.

You can install MinGW [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/)

You can install CLion [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows)

Note ethat CLion is licensed software from JetBrains. For the class, I used the evaluation period of 30 days to build the projects.
## Python
To begin learning the algorithms required for the class, we built rudimentary programs using Python. Ensure you have Python 3 installed prior to attempting to run the programs.

You can download Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Disclaimer
Not all code was written by me as some was provided by the class.
